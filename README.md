# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains four levels of machine learning experiments focusing on different aspects of data analysis and modeling.

## ðŸ“Œ Levels Implemented
### Level 0: Data Understanding & Shape Analysis
- Loaded the dataset and explored its dimensions.
- Identified missing values and data types.

### Level 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Visualized distributions and feature correlations.

### Level 2: Logistic Regression Model
- Implemented logistic regression using Newton-CG optimization.
- Faced challenges with accuracy and explored alternative approaches.

### Level 3: Neural Network Model
- Built a deep learning model with multiple layers.
- Optimized performance using AdamW and batch normalization.
- Implemented SHAP for explainability.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow & Keras**
- **scikit-learn**
- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**
- **Matplotlib for visualization**
